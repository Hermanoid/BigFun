# Beguiling Interactive Game For Unraveling N-Connect (BIG FUN)

This project was designed as a challenge final project for CSCI 200: Programming Concepts
it implements a connect-N game with a command-line interface using the ncurses library,
and also features player and player stat persistence via a JSON file.

The game goes something like this: At the start of the game, the players are given a chance to enter their information. If they are recognized from past games, their account is loaded and their stats are displayed - otherwise, they set up as a new player. The players can then select the size of their game map - itâ€™s Connect N, not Connect 4, after all. Finally, the players can duke it out in a battle of wits until the game detects a winner.
